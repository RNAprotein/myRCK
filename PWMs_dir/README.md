This directory contains the KNN predicted PWMs for more than 1000 poorly studied KH proteins which were extracted from cisbp-rna database. It contains:
* protein.zip. The zipped file contains fasta sequences for the poorly studied proteins on cisbp-rna database. These proteins are all extracted from the "inferred" category of [cisbp-rna database](http://cisbp-rna.ccbr.utoronto.ca/help.html). The file name corresponds to the ID of that protein in cisbp-rna database. 
* PWMs.zip. The zipped file contains all the predicted PWMs.
