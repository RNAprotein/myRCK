> Shu Yang, Junwen Wang, Raymond Ng. Inferring RNA sequence preferences for poorly studied RNA-binding proteins based on co-evolution. BMC Bioinformatics. 2018.

It contains: 
1. Scripts for the KNN method presented in the paper. And supplementary data for performance results.
2. An extended implementation of the RCK program, called KNN-RCK which takes an input PWM as its sequence model.
3. The data used in the paper were downloaded from public databases and published papers: 
...* CISBP database <http://cisbp.ccbr.utoronto.ca/>
